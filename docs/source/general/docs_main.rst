FastEMRIWaveforms Publications
================================

The Fast EMRI Waveforms papers can be found at `arxiv.org/2104.04582 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04582>`_ and `arxiv.org/2008.06071 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06071>`_. Below is a brief description of the model. Please refer to the paper for plots and more detailed information.

Fast EMRI Waveform models are built for fast evaluation of the EMRI waveform summation equation, given by (`Drasco & Hughes 2006 <https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0509101>`_),

.. math:: h_+ + ih_x=r^{-1}\sum_{lmkn}A_{lmkn}(t)e^{-i\Phi_{mkn}(t)}V_{lmkn}(\theta,\phi),
    :label: emri_wave_eq

where :math:`h_+ + ih_x` is the two polarizations of the gravitational wave; :math:`r` is the distance; :math:`l,m,k,n` are orbital angular momentum, azimuthal, polar, and radial harmonic indices, respectively; :math:`A_{lmkn}(t)` is a complex amplitude function at time :math:`t`; :math:`A(t)` is a complex amplitude function at time :math:`t`; :math:`\Phi_{mkn}(t)=m\omega_\phi + k\omega_\theta + n\omega_r` where :math:`\omega` is the fundamental frequency for a given direction; and :math:`V_{lmkn}(\theta,\phi`) is the harmonic projection functions based on viewing angles :math:`\theta,phi`. The various modules in this package deal with separate pieces of this equation. The amplitude (:mod:`few.amplitude`) module deals with :math:`A_{lmkn}(t)`. The trajectory (:mod:`few.trajectory`) module finds the orbital trajectories (:math:`p(t), e(t), x_I(t)`) which are fed into the amplitude module and phase trajectories (:math:`\Phi_\phi, \Phi_\theta, \Phi_r`) that are fed into the final summation. Utility modules aid this process from the utilities package (:mod:`few.utils`). Once such utility module is the calculation of :math:`V_{lmkn}(\theta,\phi`) (this is currently limited to the spin-weighted spherical harmonics for Schwarzschild eccentric). For completeness, :math:`A_{lmkn}` is given by,

.. math:: A_{lmkn} = -2Z_{lmkn}(a, p, e, x_I)/\omega_{mkn}^2,

where :math:`Z_{lmkn}(a, p, e, x_I)` is the teukolsky amplitudes associated with a geodesic with spin, :math:`a`; semilatus rectum, :math:`p`p; eccentricity, :math:`e`; and inclination, :math:`x_I`. :math:`\omega_{mkn}` is the summation of fundamental frequencies of the geodesic with integer weights equivalent to the mode indices. The angular function, :math:`V_{lmkn}` is given by,

.. math:: V_{lmkn}(\theta, \phi) = (s=-2)S_{lmkn}(\theta)e^{im\phi},

where :math:`S_{lmkn}(\theta)` is the general angular function from `Drasco & Hughes 2006 <https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0509101>`_ (spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics).

When these modules complete their calculations, the summation (:mod:`few.summation`) module takes all of this information and creates an EMRI waveform.
