# few: Fast EMRI Waveforms

This package contains the highly modular framework for fast and accurate extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) waveforms from [arxiv.org/2104.04582](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04582) and [arxiv.org/2008.06071](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06071). The waveforms in this package combine a variety of separately accessible modules to form EMRI waveforms on both CPUs and GPUs. Generally, the modules fall into four categories: trajectory, amplitudes, summation, and utilities. Please see the [documentation](https://bhptoolkit.org/FastEMRIWaveforms/) for further information on these modules. The code can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/FastEMRIWaveforms). The data necessary for various modules in this package will automatically download the first time it is needed. If you would like to view the data, it can be found on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3981654#.XzS_KRNKjlw). The current and all past code release zip files can also be found on Zenodo [here](https://zenodo.org/record/8190418). Please see the [citation](#citation) section below for information on citing FEW.

This package is a part of the [Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit](https://bhptoolkit.org/).

If you use all or any parts of this code, please cite [arxiv.org/2104.04582](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04582) and [arxiv.org/2008.06071](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06071). See the [documentation](https://bhptoolkit.org/FastEMRIWaveforms/) to properly cite specific modules.

## Getting Started

Below is a quick set of instructions to get you started with `few`.

0) [Install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) if you do not have it.

1) Clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/FastEMRIWaveforms.git
cd FastEMRIWaveforms
```
2) Install FEW into a new conda environment called "few_env". (**Note**: If you already have performed installation and you are updating FEW after a `git pull`, then run `pip install .` rather than the following command.)

  ```
  bash install.sh
  ```

3) Load the environment: 
```
conda activate few_env
```
4) In a python file or notebook:
```
import few
```
See [examples notebook](https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/FastEMRIWaveforms/blob/master/examples/FastEMRIWaveforms_tutorial.ipynb).


### Prerequisites

To install this software for CPU usage, you need [gsl >2.0](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) , [lapack (3.6.1)](https://www.netlib.org/lapack/lug/node14.html), Python >3.4, wget, and NumPy. If you install lapack with conda, the new version (3.9) seems to not install the correct header files. Therefore, the lapack version must be 3.6.1. To run the examples, you will also need jupyter and matplotlib. We generally recommend installing everything, including gcc and g++ compilers, in the conda environment as is shown in the examples here. This generally helps avoid compilation and linking issues. If you use your own chosen compiler, you will need to make sure all necessary information is passed to the setup command (see below). You also may need to add information to the `setup.py` file.

To install this software for use with NVIDIA GPUs (compute capability >2.0), you need the [CUDA toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html) and [CuPy](https://cupy.chainer.org/). The CUDA toolkit must have cuda version >8.0. Be sure to properly install CuPy within the correct CUDA toolkit version. Make sure the nvcc binary is on `$PATH` or set it as the `CUDA_HOME` environment variable.

There are a set of files required for total use of this package. They will download automatically the first time they are needed. Files are generally under 10MB. However, there is a 100MB file needed for the slow waveform and the bicubic amplitude interpolation. This larger file will only download if you run either of those two modules. The files are hosted on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3981654#.XzS_KRNKjlw).

### Installing


0) [Install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) if you do not have it.

1) Clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/FastEMRIWaveforms.git
cd FastEMRIWaveforms
```

2) Installation is made easy through [install.sh](install.sh). This is a bash script that will create a conda environment, install FEW, run tests, and install any additional packages needed for sampling or development. It will look for an `nvcc` binary, the `CUDA_HOME` variable, or the `CUDAHOME` variable. If it finds that information, it will install for CUDA as well (including installing the proper version of `cupy`). **Note**: If you already have performed installation and you are updating FEW after a `git pull`, then run `pip install .` rather than the following command.

  ```
  bash install.sh
  ```

  Options for installation can be applied by running `bash install.sh key=value`. These can be found with `bash install.sh -h`:
  
  ```
  keyword argument options (given as key=value):
    env_name:  Name of generated conda environment. Default is 'few_env'.
    install_type:  Type of install. 'basic', 'development', or 'sampling'. 
        'development' adds packages needed for development and documentation.
        'sampling' adds packages for sampling like eryn, lisatools, corner, chainconsumer.
        Default is 'basic'. 
    run_tests: Either true or false. Whether to run tests after install. Default is true.
  ```

3) Load the environment (change "few_env" to the correct environment name is specified in previous step):

```
conda activate few_env
```

Please contact the developers if the installation does not work.

### More Customized Installation (legacy)

0) [Install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) if you do not have it.

1) Create a virtual environment.

```
conda create -n few_env -c conda-forge gcc_linux-64 gxx_linux-64 wget gsl lapack=3.6.1 hdf5 numpy Cython scipy tqdm jupyter ipython h5py requests matplotlib python=3.7
conda activate few_env
```

    If on MACOSX, substitute `gcc_linux-64` and `gxx_linus-64` with `clang_osx-64` and `clangxx_osx-64`.

    If you want a faster install, you can install the python packages (numpy, Cython, scipy, tqdm, jupyter, ipython, h5py, requests, matplotlib) with pip.

2) Clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/FastEMRIWaveforms.git
cd FastEMRIWaveforms
```

3) If using GPUs, use pip to [install cupy](https://docs-cupy.chainer.org/en/stable/install.html). If you have cuda version 9.2, for example:

```
pip install cupy-cuda92
```

4) Run install.

```
python setup.py install
```


When installing lapack and gsl, the setup file will default to assuming lib and include for both are in installed within the conda environment. To provide other lib and include directories you can provide command line options when installing. You can also remove usage of OpenMP.

```
python setup.py --help
usage: setup.py [-h] [--lapack_lib LAPACK_LIB]
                [--lapack_include LAPACK_INCLUDE] [--lapack LAPACK]
                [--gsl_lib GSL_LIB] [--gsl_include GSL_INCLUDE] [--gsl GSL]
                [--ccbin CCBIN]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --lapack_lib LAPACK_LIB
                        Directory of the lapack lib. If you add lapack lib,
                        must also add lapack include.
  --lapack_include LAPACK_INCLUDE
                        Directory of the lapack include. If you add lapack
                        includ, must also add lapack lib.
  --lapack LAPACK       Directory of both lapack lib and include. '/include'
                        and '/lib' will be added to the end of this string.
  --gsl_lib GSL_LIB     Directory of the gsl lib. If you add gsl lib, must
                        also add gsl include.
  --gsl_include GSL_INCLUDE
                        Directory of the gsl include. If you add gsl include,
                        must also add gsl lib.
  --gsl GSL             Directory of both gsl lib and include. '/include' and
                        '/lib' will be added to the end of this string.
  --ccbin CCBIN         path/to/compiler to link with nvcc when installing
                        with CUDA.
```

When installing the package with `python setup.py install`, the setup file uses the C compiler present in your `PATH`. However, it might happen that the setup file incorrectly uses another compiler present on your path. To solve this issue you can directly specify the C compiler using the flag `--ccbin` as in the following example:

```
python setup.py install --ccbin /path/to/anaconda3/envs/few_env/bin/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu-gcc
```

or if on MACOSX:

```
python setup.py install --ccbin /path/to/anaconda3/envs/few_env/bin/x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0-clang
```

## Running the Tests

In the main directory of the package run in the terminal (if you run [install.sh](install.sh) with defaults, the tests will be performed):
```
python -m unittest discover
```


## Contributing
